Predicting Cell Growth with Multi-omics Data Using Machine Learning 
We propose a feature engineering framework named HDMPPK. At the same time, random search, grid search, ant colony optimization algorithm, Harris hawk optimization algorithm and Bayesian optimizer are used to optimize the hyperparameters. Select K-neighbors regressor, support vector regression, Four machine learning models, convolutional neural network and Long Short Term Memory Network, predict the growth rate of Bacillus subtilis cells
